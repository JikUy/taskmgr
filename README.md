# Taskmgr disabler

This is taskmgr disabler (Taskmgr.exe)

How it works:

1. File is gonna ask for administrator permission.

2. File is going to work in background. The name is gonna be wpesv.exe ( Windows Portable Executable System Version )

3. It will taskkill Taskmgr.exe and brute force taskkill:

      Taskmgr.exe
      taskmgr.exe
      TASKMGR.exe
      TASKMGR.Exe
      Taskmgr.Exe
      taskmgr.Exe
      Taskmgr.EXE
      taskmgr.EXE

For now there is no applications to access taskmgr.exe again, you need to restart your pc.

WARING: THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES NOT FOR ANY BAD USES

Main file: wpesv.exe
